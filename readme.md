## 🪨 📄 ✂️ (Rock, Paper, Scissors) <img alt="" align="right" src="https://badges.pufler.dev/visits/riccardoshrives/Rock-Paper-Scissors?style=for-the-badge&color=A7D9B2&logoColor=white&labelColor=1C2325"/>

This was my very first **Javascript** project. I followed [this tutorial from Dev Ed](https://youtu.be/qWPtKtYEsN4) but also made some modifications.

### My modifications:
* Updated colors
* Used relative sizing where possible
* Added button hover animations
* Ensured fists are closed when doing the shaking animation
