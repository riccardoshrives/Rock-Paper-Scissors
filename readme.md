## **Rock, Paper, Scissors** (The game)

This was my very first **Javascript** project. I follow [this tutorial from Dev Ed](https://youtu.be/qWPtKtYEsN4) but also made some modifications.

### My modifications:
* Updated colors
* Used relative sizing where possible
* Added button hover animations
* Ensured fists are closed when doing the shaking animation
